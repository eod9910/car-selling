        [ ] Specifying fields for each collection
        [ ] Determining relationships between collections
        [ ] Considering indexing for performance
        [ ] Data validation and constraints
                [ ]   Defining rules for data integrity e.g., required fields, value   ranges
        [ ] Scalability considerations
                Planning for potential growth in data volume and complexity
        [ ] Data normalization vs denormalization
                 Balancing between data consistency and query performance
                 Versioning strategy
        [ ] Planning for schema evolution over time
        [ ] Security and access control
                Defining field-level security if needed
        [ ] Audit trails
                Tracking changes to critical data
        [ ] Archiving strategy
                Planning for long-term data storage and retrieval
